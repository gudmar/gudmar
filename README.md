- 👋 Hi, I’m Marek,
- 👀 **I’m interested in**: programming. Mostly web developement. Currently _front-end_ part, but I am willing to learn _full-stack_
- 🌱 **I’m currently learning** ... React, Angular, SCSS, about design patterns,
- 💞️ **I’m looking for opportunity to** start career as front end developer
- 📫 **How to reach me**: https://gudmar.github.io/myProjects/aboutMe

Currently I am working on a web page about web development. The best way to learn is to write about it :). However, still a long journey before my 
web page will come out from the development phase. It is very time consuming...
